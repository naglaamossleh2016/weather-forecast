## Weather Forcast App
### Project Description
In this project, you will develop a weather prediction application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and the Tkinter library. 
The application will display real-time weather information based on a user-selected location, providing details such as:

Temperature in Celsius (Â°C)

Humidity (%)

Wind Speed (km/h)

Chance of Rainfall (%)

Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)

### Features
Location Selection: Users can choose a specific location for which they want to predict the weather.

Real-time Updates: The application will provide up-to-date weather information, ensuring users receive the latest data.

Temperature Display: Show the temperature in Celsius, providing users with a clear understanding of the current weather conditions.

Humidity Information: Display the humidity percentage, giving users insights into the moisture level in the air.

Wind Speed: Present the wind speed in kilometers per hour, helping users anticipate windy conditions.

Rainfall Probability: Communicate the likelihood of rainfall as a percentage, assisting users in planning their activities accordingly.

Atmospheric Pressure: Show the atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa), offering additional insights into the weather conditions.

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Weather API: Choose a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and integrate it into your application.
